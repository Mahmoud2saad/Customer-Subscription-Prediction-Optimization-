# Customer-Subscription-Prediction-Optimization-

Overview
This project aims to predict customer subscription to a banking product using logistic regression. By analyzing client data such as demographics, past interactions, and economic indicators, the model identifies potential subscribers, aiding in targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset
The dataset comprises client information sourced from [source_name/link]. It includes attributes like age, job type, marital status, education level, housing loan status, and contact history from past marketing campaigns.

Project Structure
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Explored data distributions, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables. Conducted feature scaling and outlier detection for data normalization.

Model Building: Implemented logistic regression to model subscription likelihood. Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE technique to enhance model performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated model effectiveness using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Optimized model parameters through GridSearchCV for enhanced performance.

Results and Insights
Training Accuracy: Achieved [0.99 %], demonstrating robust performance on training data.
Test Accuracy: Evaluated at [0.91 %], highlighting model capability on unseen data.
Precision and Recall: Balanced trade-offs between precision and recall, focusing on identifying true positives effectively.
Optimal Threshold Analysis: Explored various thresholds to refine model predictions, maximizing performance metrics.
Next Steps
Further Optimization: Explore advanced feature engineering techniques and parameter tuning to improve model accuracy and robustness.
Business Impact: Discuss potential applications of predictive insights in optimizing marketing campaigns and enhancing client engagement strategies.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
